Demos live here. Proof of concept widgets and ideas that the Kingdom Web Office would like your feedback on.
</p><p>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">DEMOS ARE <b>NOT</b> FEATURE COMPLETE</span>
</p><p>
<b>NO</b> current features will be removed from existing systems without careful consideration. If you don't see something here that is <b>ALREADY</b> in an existing system then that is most likely because it already works well and I see no reason to spend hours reinventing wheels that are already spinning. Please trust me on this one. I may occasionally sneak in a new feature here or there, if it makes sense, but I'll never sneak one out.

Finally - Atlantia has a lot of developers and technically savy people (have you considered being a web minister :-) ). I know you're going to poke around. I will occassionally troll the site access logs and yes - I see you poking and proding. Generally; this activity is ENCOURAGED! If you find something broken, tell me, I'll get it fixed! If, on the otherhand, you pull a dumb... I will not be so... <i>encouraging</i>.
